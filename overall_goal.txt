Overall goal:

Our goal is to make a homegrown simple like instagram like app. We want to be able to upload images and text, and have them in a chronological feed with pagination.

We have both vercel blob storage and vercel kv connected with these env variables below
GOOGLE_ID
GOOGLE_SECRET
ADMIN_EMAIL
NEXTAUTH_SECRET
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN
NEXTAUTH_URL
KV_URL
KV_REST_API_URL
KV_REST_API_TOKEN
KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN
REDIS_URL
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET

We want simple google auth, and we want individuals to be able to create accounts with username and bio (linked in the backend to their google login email)
On start, we want to go to the / route and see sign up with google and a sign in button - if they click sign up they log in with google auth, then are taken to a page to set their username (which checks if one already exists before creating) and bio

once they sign up they are taken to /<their username>

On this page we see their username and bio, and then a post image and post text button

If they click post image they see a upload photo button, and when they upload an image it previews it and there is a text box below to add a caption - below this there is a back button that sets it back to the post image/post text buttons
if they click post, we want to save the date the image was taken from the metadata, then we want to strip the metadata and compress and optimize the image before posting
this posts the image to their /<username> page as they are authenticated, and can only post to their own profile

the post is uploaded to vercel blob storage and the stuff like caption is saved in kv
so for each post we want to see
- the image
- the caption 
- when the photo was posted
- when the image was taken

these posts show up in chronological order. 

When logged in we want this user to be able to delete and edit captions / edit text posts

There should also be a way to post a text only post, that can be edited when logged in

when not logged in you should be able to view any users posts, but obviously not edit delete or post
